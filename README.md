# HEX

## A graphical user interface for playing HEX

## About
This project serves as a template for the computerlab project at the Institute for Mathematical Optimization at TU Braunschweig in winter semester 2023/2024.

## Installation

Generally, all required packages can be installed with pip (1). We recommend creating a virtual environment (2) in Python via

``python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment``.

Then, install all packages via

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

into the newly created virtual environment.
